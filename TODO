Short Term
- Refactor babelfish.py to move Spark specific methods into the spark 
  subdirectory.
- Refactor "fish" action block in __main__ to move some of that code into
  its own method (readability)
- Add support for spinning up a web environment in Google Cloud Platform 
  to establish webhooks in Spark for more realtime operation and efficient
  message handling
- Some basic unit testing

Long Term
- Reach out to Spark developer community to understand why bots can't see
  all messages, only direct messages in a room.  Does that matter in webhook
  driven environment (probably does)?

- Would language-specific xlate rooms (instead of person specific rooms)
  work better?  Is the persistence of the translation important?

- Get better CI environment with Docker going.
